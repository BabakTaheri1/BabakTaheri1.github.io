Hello! I recently completed my PhD in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Daniel Molzahn](https://molzahn.github.io/index.html).

My passion lies in harnessing the power of mathematical optimization and machine learning techniques to foster a more reliable, resilient, affordable, and sustainable energy future. Outside of my work in research and education, I enjoy hiking, traveling, camping, watching movies, and playing soccer and volleyball.

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I earned an M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.
