Hello! I recently completed my PhD in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, and I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Daniel Molzahn](https://molzahn.github.io/index.html).

My passion lies in harnessing the power of mathematical optimization and machine learning techniques to foster a more **reliable**, **resilient**, **affordable**, and **sustainable** energy future. Outside of my work in research and education, I enjoy hiking, traveling, camping, watching movies, and playing soccer and volleyball.
